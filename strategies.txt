to detect 8088/186/286 and 386+: check EFLAGS.VM, if it's 1, it's in V86 mode that only supported in 386 and later.
386 and 486: try to enable cache. if it fails, it's 386. if it succeed, 486.


V20 and V30 is drop-in replacement for some CPUs. it may support some advanced feature...

FPUs are largely unknown!!!

for 486, earlier model doesn't have support for CPUID. maybe check for that.

check for FLAGS.bit15-11 as well, that it may change on 8088/186 and 286.

Model check may require to understand PIT...

- 0x4c00: int 21 - Exit Program

- memory constraint? 

9x: acts like HIMEM 
NT: acts like... HIMEM or V86.
OS/2: ???
